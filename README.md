**Pochi** is an AI agent designed for software development. It operates within your IDE, using a toolkit of commands to execute complex tasks, from code generation to project-wide refactoring.

## ðŸ“– What is Pochi?

Pochi's workflow is built on these principles:

*   **Agent-Based Workflow**: You assign a task, and Pochi works autonomously to complete it. It can read files, execute commands, and apply changes to your codebase.
*   **Flexible & Extensible**: Pochi's functionality is centered around a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model. This allows you to connect any supported LLM provider, giving you full control over the agent's "brain," your data privacy, and operational costs. No account is required to use the BYOK model.
*   **Cloud Services**: For teams that need collaborative features, we offer account-based services like shared task list, group billing. These services are optional and build upon the core functionality.

## âœ¨ Features

*   **Code Completion**: Get intelligent, context-aware code completions as you type.
*   **Bring Your Own Model**: Pochi supports custom AI models, so you can use your own fine-tuned models for specific tasks.
*   **Tool Usage**: Pochi has access to a set of tools that allow it to interact with your development environment, such as reading and writing files, executing commands, and searching your codebase.
