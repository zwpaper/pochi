```yaml
name: pochi

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  pochi:
    if: startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '@pochi')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: tabbyml/pochi/packages/github-action@main
        env:

Set up your `POCHI_API_KEY` secret and you're ready to go!
