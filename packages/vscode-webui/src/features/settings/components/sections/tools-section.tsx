  applyDiff:
    "This tool is designed for precision edits to existing files. It allows Pochi to apply a specific change by identifying a unique block of code or text (searchContent) and replacing it with your desired content (replaceContent). To ensure accuracy, Pochi provides enough surrounding context in searchContent to make it unique within the file. This prevents accidental changes to other parts of the code.\n\nFor example, Pochi can use applyDiff to fix a bug in a function, update a configuration value, or refactor a small piece of code. It's particularly useful when Pochi knows exactly what needs to change and wants to avoid rewriting the entire file. If Pochi needs to make the same change in multiple places, Pochi can specify expectedReplacements to ensure all instances are updated correctly.",
  askFollowupQuestion:
    "When Pochi needs more information to complete a task or when instructions are ambiguous, Pochi uses this tool to ask for clarification. This ensures that Pochi fully understands your requirements before proceeding, which helps avoid mistakes and rework. Pochi might ask you to provide more details, confirm a specific approach, or choose between different options.\n\nFor example, if you ask Pochi to 'add a button,' Pochi might use this tool to ask, 'What should the button text be, and what should happen when it's clicked?'. This interactive process helps Pochi deliver a more accurate and helpful result. Your response will guide Pochi's next steps.",
  attemptCompletion:
    "This tool marks the formal end of a task. When Pochi has completed all the steps and believes it has fulfilled your request, Pochi will use attemptCompletion to present the final result. This includes a summary of what Pochi has done, and often, a command you can run to see the changes live (like opening a web page or running a test).\n\nUsing this tool signifies that Pochi is handing the work over to you. It's the final step in Pochi's process. If you're satisfied with the result, we're done! If not, you can provide feedback, and Pochi can continue working on it.",
  executeCommand:
    "This tool gives Pochi the ability to run shell commands directly in your terminal, either in the foreground or as a background job. Foreground commands return their output when they finish. Background commands return an output file that Pochi can read while the process continues running.\n\nPochi will always explain the command it's about to run. For safety, Pochi operates within the project's working directory unless specified otherwise.",
  globFiles:
    "When Pochi needs to find a set of files based on a specific naming convention or location, Pochi uses the globFiles tool. It allows Pochi to use pattern matching (similar to what you might use in a .gitignore file) to get a list of relevant files. For example, Pochi can find all TypeScript files with *.ts, or all files in the src directory and its subdirectories with src/**/*.\n\nThis is incredibly useful for understanding the scope of a change. If you ask Pochi to refactor a component, Pochi can use globFiles to find all the files related to that component, ensuring Pochi doesn't miss anything.",
  listFiles:
    "To understand the structure of your project, Pochi uses the listFiles tool. It allows Pochi to see all the files and folders within a specific directory. Pochi can use it to explore the project tree, find important files like package.json or README.md, and get a general sense of how the codebase is organized.\n\nPochi can list the contents of a single directory or, by using the recursive option, Pochi can list all files and directories within it, no matter how deeply they are nested. This is a fundamental tool for orienting Pochi within your project.",
  multiApplyDiff:
    "The multiApplyDiff tool is an enhanced version of applyDiff that allows Pochi to make multiple, distinct changes to a single file in one atomic operation. This is extremely useful for complex refactoring tasks where several parts of a file need to be updated. For example, Pochi can rename a function, update all its call sites within the file, and change its export statement, all at once.\n\nEach change is defined by a searchContent and replaceContent pair. The changes are applied sequentially. This ensures that the file is always in a consistent state and reduces the chances of errors that might occur if Pochi were to apply each change individually.",
  readFile:
    "Before Pochi can make changes to a file, Pochi needs to understand what's inside. The readFile tool allows Pochi to read the full contents of a specified file. This is Pochi's primary way of gathering context about your code. Pochi uses it to analyze the existing logic, understand variable names, check the coding style, and identify the best place to make changes.\n\nWhether Pochi is fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or refactoring existing code, readFile is almost always one of the first tools Pochi uses to get started. It provides the necessary information for Pochi to make intelligent and informed decisions.",
  searchFiles:
    "When Pochi needs to find where a specific function is used, where a variable is defined, or where a particular error message is logged, Pochi uses the searchFiles tool. It allows Pochi to perform a regular expression search across all files in your project. This is much more powerful than a simple text search, as Pochi can look for complex patterns.\n\nFor example, if you ask Pochi to rename a function, Pochi will use searchFiles to find every instance of that function's name, so Pochi can be sure to update them all. The tool returns the file paths and the lines containing the match, giving Pochi the context it needs to proceed.",
  writeToFile:
    "The writeToFile tool is what Pochi uses when it needs to create a new file from scratch or completely replace the contents of an existing one. This is perfect for generating new components, adding new configuration files, or performing large-scale refactors where the majority of a file needs to be changed.\n\nUnlike applyDiff, which makes targeted changes, writeToFile replaces everything in the file with the new content Pochi provides. It's a powerful tool for making significant additions or modifications to your project. Pochi will always be careful to confirm that overwriting a file is the correct action.",
  renderWidget:
    "The renderWidget tool renders a local HTML/SVG widget in the VSCode chat. It is used for streaming diagrams, mockups, simple charts, art, and local interactive UI. Widgets store JSON state on a top-level <pochi-widget> element; they cannot use external APIs or load external resources.",
  killBackgroundJob:
    "When a background process is no longer needed or is causing issues, Pochi uses the killBackgroundJob tool to terminate it cleanly. This is important for resource management and ensuring that processes don't continue running unnecessarily after their purpose has been fulfilled.\n\nPochi might use this tool to stop development servers after completing work, cancel long-running builds, or terminate processes that are consuming too many resources. It gives Pochi full control over the lifecycle of background processes, ensuring efficient and clean task completion.",
  startMonitor:
    "The startMonitor tool lets Pochi watch something in the background and react when it changes, without pausing the conversation. Pochi runs a command whose output lines become events - for example tailing a log file for errors, polling a CI job for status changes, or watching a directory for file changes.\n\nMonitor events and end status are delivered proactively between steps, so Pochi can continue working and react when something happens. The monitor can be stopped with killBackgroundJob when it is no longer needed.",
  newTask:
    "The newTask tool allows Pochi to create a new task with a dedicated agent. This is useful for tasks that require a dedicated agent with specific capabilities or configurations. By using this tool, Pochi can tailor the agent's behavior to better suit the needs of the task at hand.",
  editNotebook:
    "The editNotebook tool enables Pochi to edit Jupyter notebook cells directly. It can modify the content of individual cells within .ipynb files by targeting specific cell IDs or indices. This is essential for working with data science projects, updating code cells, modifying markdown documentation, or adjusting notebook outputs. Pochi uses this tool to make precise changes to notebook cells without affecting the entire notebook structure.",
  useSkill:
    "The useSkill tool allows Pochi to access and execute specialized skills that are available in your workspace. Skills are reusable, packaged instructions for specific tasks or workflows. When you have skills configured in your workspace, Pochi can use this tool to retrieve the instructions for a particular skill and then follow those instructions to complete complex, domain-specific tasks.\n\nFor example, if you have a skill for 'code review', 'database migration', or 'API documentation generation', Pochi can use this tool to access those specialized workflows. This extends Pochi's capabilities beyond its built-in tools, allowing it to leverage custom automation and best practices specific to your project or organization.",
