    `Start a background monitor that streams events from a long-running command. Each stdout line is an event delivered proactively between steps, so you can keep working while notifications arrive. Events arrive on their own schedule and are automated notifications, not replies from the user, even if one arrives while you are waiting for the user to answer.

Use a monitor for repeated occurrences or a sequence of results:
- Ongoing occurrences ("tell me every time an ERROR appears"): use an unbounded command such as \`tail -f\`, \`fswatch\`, or a polling loop.
- Occurrences with a known end ("report each CI check until the run completes"): emit each result and exit after the terminal state.
- A command that exits after one event is valid, but do not use an unbounded command when only one notification is needed. It remains armed after the event until timeout or cancellation.

Your command's stdout is the event stream. Each line becomes an event; lines produced within 200ms may be delivered as one batch. Command exit ends the monitor and its exit status is reported.

Examples:
- Each matching log line is an event: \`tail -f app.log | grep -E --line-buffered "ERROR|FAILED|Killed|OOM"\`
- Each file change is an event: \`fswatch /watched/dir\`
- Poll a PR, emit one line for each newly completed check, and exit when all checks reach a terminal state.

Script quality:
- Every pipe stage must flush per line or matches may remain buffered: grep needs \`--line-buffered\`; awk needs \`fflush()\`. Avoid \`head\`, which can delay output until enough matches accumulate.
- CLI monitors use stdout as the event stream; VS Code terminal monitors include stdout and stderr. Merge with \`2>&1\` when failures written to stderr should reach your filter in either host.
- In polling loops, tolerate transient request failures and use suitable intervals: 30s or more for remote APIs, 0.5-1s for local checks.
- Write a specific description because it appears in every notification.

Coverage and volume:
- Silence is not success. When watching for an outcome, emit every terminal state you would act on, including failure, cancellation, timeout, crashes, and the expected success state.
- Filter selectively to actionable signals; never stream raw logs. Frequent events are merged and delivered with the next model request, or resume an idle task when it can accept notifications. When events accumulate, notifications retain recent lines and report omissions; read outputFile for full output. The monitor continues running.

After starting a monitor, continue with other work. If there is nothing else to do, use attemptCompletion to end the current turn; monitor events will resume the task. Do not keep the turn active by repeatedly checking process output.

The default timeout is 5 minutes. Use persistent only for an explicitly requested session-length watch. Use killBackgroundJob to stop the monitor early.`.trim(),
