We added **Skills** to Pochi.

As tasks grow more complex, users often end up repeatedly explaining the same details to the agent, including output formatting, API usage, and internal conventions.

Skills turn those repeated instructions into reusable capabilities.

In Pochi, skills live alongside your code, are easy to inspect and edit, and plug directly into tasks. They can be automatically discovered, explicitly invoked, and combined with other features like Plan Mode, reviews, and scoped tool access.

That means skills are here to shape how work actually gets done. You can standardize workflows, or integrate tools once, and then reuse that behavior consistently across tasks and projects.
