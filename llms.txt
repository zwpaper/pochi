# Auto Compact

Auto Compact helps you keep long conversations efficient by summarizing earlier messages when your token usage grows large. You can either:

* Compact in the current task (inject a compact summary so you can continue seamlessly)
* Start a new task with the summary (spawn a fresh task seeded with a concise recap)

![Auto Compact overview](../assets/images/auto-compact.png)

## When Auto Compact is available

Auto Compact becomes available from the token usage chip in the toolbar when all of the following are true:

* The conversation isn’t streaming or executing
* The chat isn’t read-only
* No other compact action is pending
* Total tokens ≥ 50,000 (min threshold)

If the threshold isn’t met, you’ll see a tooltip explaining that more tokens are required to compact.

While compacting, the chip shows a spinner with the “Compacting” label.

![Compacting in progress](../assets/images/auto-compacting.png)

## Two ways to compact

### Option A — Compact in current task

Use this to stay in the same task. Pochi will:

1. Generate a concise summary of the conversation up to your latest message
2. Inject a compact block at the top of your last user message
3. Continue the conversation with the condensed context

> Notes: The summary is wrapped into a compact section and prepended to your last message to preserve intent while saving context.

### Option B — Start new task with summary

Use this to branch a fresh task based on the current work. Pochi will:

1. Create a summary of the existing conversation
2. Open a new task seeded with the summary and a short handoff message
3. Navigate you to the new task to continue

![Inline compact summary in current task (expandable)](../assets/images/auto-compact-with-new-task-summery.png)

## Technical Details

* Trigger: You choose either “Compact task” (inline) or “New task with summary”.
* Summary prompt: Pochi asks the model to produce a concise recap focused on key topics, decisions, and important context (limited to a few thousand tokens of output).
* Inline compact: The recap is wrapped in a compact block and prepended to your last user message before the next response.
* New task: The recap becomes the first message of a brand-new task, followed by a short instruction letting the agent analyze status and confirm next steps.
* Safety/availability: Buttons are disabled during streaming/execution, or when below the minimum token threshold.

## Tips

* Prefer inline compact when you want continuity within the same task.
* Use “new task with summary” to cleanly branch, hand over, or checkpoint work.
* You’ll see a “Compacting” state while the summary is being generated—this can take a moment for very long threads.


# Checkpoints

icon: "Route"

# Checkpoints

Checkpoints automatically save a snapshot of your workspace after key steps in a task. They help you track changes, roll back when needed, and explore different implementations without worrying about breaking your code.

<div align="center">
  ![Checkpoint overview](../assets/images/checkpoint-overview.png)
</div>

## How checkpoints work

Pochi creates a checkpoint after important actions such as file edits or applied fixes. These checkpoints:

* Run alongside your Git workflow without interference
* Preserve the conversation context when restoring (chat and task context remain intact)
* Track file changes using a shadow Git repository (no writes to your real repository)

Example: while developing a feature, the assistant updates multiple files. Each change creates a checkpoint. You can review each modification, and if needed, roll back to any point without impacting your main branch or real Git history.

## Viewing changes and restoring

After each key action, you can:

1. Click Compare to see modified files and diffs
2. Click Restore to open restore options

<div align="center">
  ![Checkpoint compare](../assets/images/checkpoint-compare.png)
</div>

## Restore options

To go back to a previous point:

1. Click Restore next to any step
2. Choose how you want to restore:
   * Restore Workspace and Task (when available): revert both code and task context
   * Restore Task Only (when available): keep code changes, revert task context
   * Restore Workspace Only: revert code while preserving task context (current default)

Note: The current version focuses on “Restore Workspace Only.” Other options will appear as their capabilities are enabled.

<div align="center">
  ![Checkpoint restore options](../assets/images/checkpoints-restore.png)
</div>

## Under the hood

In VS Code, Pochi implements checkpoints with a shadow Git that stays separate from your real repository:

* Initializes a bare repository under the extension’s storage directory (scoped per workspace)
* Points the worktree to your workspace, then stages and commits changes into the shadow repo
* Excludes common large/binary/cache/build artifacts (see Exclusions) to keep things fast and stable

This shadow repo is fully independent. Saving or restoring checkpoints does not create commits in your actual Git repository.

## Requirements

* **Git** must be installed (the shadow Git depends on it). If Git isn’t available, the checkpoint feature can’t initialize and will be disabled.

## Smart detection and exclusions

Pochi automatically detects and excludes heavy or redundant files to keep checkpoints lean and fast, including:

* Build artifacts and dependency folders
* Media files and large binaries
* Cache, logs, and temporary files
* Environment configuration files
* Files tracked by Git LFS

With this smart filtering, checkpoints focus on core code changes—making diffs clearer and restores faster.

# CLI

Pochi offers a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to run an AI agent directly from the command line.

## Oneliner Install

<Tabs items={['Curl', 'Homebrew', 'NPM']}>
  <Tab value="Curl">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://getpochi.com/install.sh | bash
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Homebrew">
    ```bash
    brew install tabbyml/pochi/pochi
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="NPM">
    ```bash
    npm install -g @getpochi/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authentication

The Pochi CLI uses the same authentication credentials as the VS Code extension for Pochi's cloud services. When you sign in through the VS Code extension, the CLI automatically reuses these credentials.

Credentials are stored in `~/.pochi/config.jsonc`. To authenticate:

1. Install and open the [Pochi VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabbyML.pochi)
2. Follow the sign-in prompts in the extension
3. The CLI will automatically use the same credentials

For non-Pochi models, first configure it in your Pochi configuration file (`~/.pochi/config.jsonc`). See [Models documentation](./models.mdx) for details on how to configure custom providers.

Then you can use the model by specifying the provider and model ID separated by a slash:

```bash
pochi --model groq/llama3-8b-8192 -p "What is the time now?"
```

## Usage

You can pass a prompt to run a task:

```bash
pochi -p "What is the time now?"
```

Or pipe input as a prompt:

```bash
echo "What is the time now?" | pochi
```

For detailed usage instructions, run `pochi -h`, below is the output fom version 0.5.3

```
Usage: pochi [options]

Pochi v0.5.5

Prompt:
  -p, --prompt <prompt>   Create a new task with the given prompt. You can also
                          pipe input to use as a prompt, for example: `cat
                          .pochi/workflows/create-pr.md | pochi`. To use a
                          workflow, use /workflow-name, for example: `pochi -p
                          /create-pr`. Workflows can be embedded in larger
                          prompts, for example: `pochi -p "please /create-pr
                          with feat semantic convention"`

Options:
  --max-steps <number>    Maximum number of stepsto run the task. If the task
                          cannot be completed in this number of rounds, the
                          runner will stop. (default: 24)
  --max-retries <number>  Maximum number of retries to run the task in a single
                          step. (default: 3)

Model:
  --model <model>         The model to use for the task. (default:
                          "qwen/qwen3-coder")

Others:
  -V, --version           Print the version string.
  -h, --help              Print this help message.
```

## Debugging

To enable debug logging for the CLI, you can set the `POCHI_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
POCHI_LOG=debug pochi -p "What is the time now?"
```

This will output detailed logs about the CLI's operation, which can be helpful for troubleshooting issues.

For more granular control, you can specify log levels for specific components:

```bash
POCHI_LOG=Pochi=debug,TaskRunner=trace pochi -p "What is the time now?"
```

description: Learn how to create and use custom agents in Pochi.
----------------------------------------------------------------

# Custom Agents

Pochi allows you to define custom agents to handle specific tasks. These agents can be tailored with their own system prompts and sets of tools, enabling you to create specialized assistants for your workflows.

## Defining a Custom Agent

Custom agents are defined in `.md` files located in either the project's `.pochi/agents/` directory or the system-wide `~/.pochi/agents/` directory.

An agent definition file consists of two parts: a frontmatter section for configuration and a content section for the system prompt.

Here is an example of a custom agent definition:

```markdown
---
description: Description of when this custom agent should be invoked
tools:
  - tool-1
  - tool-2
  - tool-3
---

Your custom agent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs
and should clearly define the custom agent's role, capabilities, and approach
to solving problems.

Include specific instructions, best practices, and any constraints
the custom agent should follow.
```

If the agent is saved as `my-agent.md` and the `name` attribute is omitted, `my-agent` will be used as the agent name.

### Configuration

The frontmatter provides metadata for the custom agent:

* `name` (optional): A unique name for your agent. If omitted, the filename (without the extension) is used as the name.
* `description` (required): A short description of what the agent does. This is used to help Pochi decide when to use your agent.
* `tools` (optional): A list of tools that the agent is allowed to use. This can be a comma-separated string (e.g., `tool-1, tool-2`) or a YAML array. If omitted, the agent inherits all available tools.

### System Prompt

The content of the file after the frontmatter is the system prompt for the agent. This prompt should define the agent's role, capabilities, and how it should behave.

## Using a Custom Agent

You can mention the custom agent's name in your prompt, and Pochi may decide to use it based on the context.

## Managing Custom Agents

You can manage your custom agents through the Pochi interface or by directly manipulating the agent definition files. The common operations include:

* **List**: View all available agents in the `.pochi/agents/` directory or in Pochi settings.
* **Create**: Create a new `.md` file in the `.pochi/agents/` directory.
* **Delete**: Remove the corresponding agent file.
* **Edit**: Modify the agent's definition file.

</Callout>

## Getting Your API Keys

1. Log in to your Pochi account and go to **API Keys** from your user menu

![User button overview](../assets/images/api-overview.png)

2. Create a new API key with a descriptive name
3. Copy the generated key (it's only shown once)

![API page interface](../assets/images/api-page-interface.png)

4. Add it to your GitHub repository as a secret named `POCHI_API_KEY`. See [GitHub's official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets) for detailed steps:
   * Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
   * Click **"New repository secret"**
   * Name: `POCHI_API_KEY`, Value: your API key

## Setup

Create a workflow file `.github/workflows/pochi.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: pochi

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  pochi:
    if: startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/pochi')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Run pochi
        uses: tabbyml/pochi/packages/github-action@main
        env:
          # Required: Pochi session token (get it from app.getpochi.com and add as a repository secret)
          POCHI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.POCHI_API_KEY }}
          # Optional: custom model (defaults to CLI's default model if not set)
          # See the Models page for model options and configuration
          # POCHI_MODEL: google/gemini-2.5-pro
```

Notes:

* Triggered by `issue_comment` (created) and runs only if the comment body starts with `/pochi`
* Requires write permissions to read changes, post comments, and add reactions to PRs
* Provide `POCHI_API_KEY` via env; optionally set `POCHI_MODEL` to customize the model
* By default, the action uses GitHub's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (github-actions bot). You can customize this by setting a custom `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with your own Personal Access Token (PAT)

## Usage

Comment on a PR with `/pochi` followed by your request, e.g. `/pochi review this code`, `/pochi explain the changes in this PR`, `/pochi suggest improvements`.

![Comment example](../assets/images/github-comment.png)

Once triggered:

* Pochi reacts to your comment with 👀 to indicate it's running
* A progress comment is updated every 15 seconds
* When finished, it posts the final result and reacts with 🚀 (success) or −1 (failure)

![Progress example](../assets/images/github-progress.png)

![Actions run example](../assets/images/github-action-run.png)

Permission requirement: Only users with write/admin permission can trigger execution. Otherwise, an error will be posted as a comment.

## Advanced configuration

### Use a custom GitHub token (optional)

By default, the action uses the GitHub-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`. For cross-repo or higher-privileged operations, you can override it with a PAT:

```yaml
- name: Run pochi
  uses: tabbyml/pochi/packages/github-action@main
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Your PAT
    POCHI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.POCHI_API_KEY }}
```

### Permissions

Ensure the workflow includes these permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write # Read repo contents and commit changes if needed
  issues: write # Comment on issues/PRs
  pull-requests: write # Access PR information and status
```

## Installation

Install the Pochi extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabbyML.pochi) or [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/TabbyML/pochi).

We recommend dragging Pochi to the right side of your VSCode window to get the best experience.

![Drag to right sidebar](../assets/images/vscode-right-sidebar.png)

With Pochi, you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys. Use the VS Code command `Pochi: Open Custom Model Settings` to open the settings file and [configure it](./models). Alternatively, Pochi offers cloud-based services. Creating a Pochi account gives you access to:

* Pochi's managed LLM models
* Shared task histories and team management
* Integrations with GitHub and Slack for a collaborative workflow

To use these features, sign up at [app.getpochi.com](http://app.getpochi.com) and log in to your VS Code extension.

## Customize

Pochi supports hierarchical configuration with both global (user-level) and workspace-specific settings.

1. **Global Configuration**: `~/.pochi/config.jsonc` - Your default configuration available across all projects
2. **Workspace Configuration**: `.pochi/config.jsonc` - Project-specific configuration that override or extend global settings

You can tailor Pochi to your needs by editing these configuration file. The file uses the JSONC (JSON with Comments) format, so you can add notes to explain your settings.

```jsonc
{
  // The schema enables autocompletion and validation in your code editor.
  "$schema": "https://getpochi.com/config.schema.json",

  // For details on available options, see the "Models," "Rules," pages in the sidebar
  // ...
}
```


# MCP

--------------

# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** revolutionizes how Pochi interacts with external services, databases, and APIs. Think of MCP as a universal adapter that connects Pochi to virtually any data source or tool, dramatically expanding what your AI assistant can accomplish.

## Configure

Use the VSCode command `Pochi: Open MCP Server Settings` to open the settings.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

After saving the configuration, you will see the MCP server appear in the **Tools** section of Pochi's settings page.

![MCP Server Context7](../assets/images/mcp-context7.png)

You can use the toggle switch to enable or disable the MCP server entirely. You can also click on the tool badge to toggle individual tools within the MCP server.

## Examples

### Local MCP Servers (Stdio Transport)

```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
      "/path/to/allowed/files"
    ],
    "env": {
      "HOME": "/Users/yourname"
    }
  }
}
```

### Remote MCP Servers (HTTP Transport)

#### Custom API Server

```json
{
  "my-api": {
    "url": "https://api.mycompany.com/mcp",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-token",
      "X-API-Version": "v1"
    }
  }
}
```

#### SSE (Server-Sent Events) Server

```json
{
  "realtime-data": {
    "url": "https://data.example.com/mcp/sse",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer your-token"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Hierarchy

Pochi supports hierarchical MCP configuration with both global (user-level) and workspace-specific settings.

1. **Global Configuration**: `~/.pochi/config.jsonc` - Your default MCP servers available across all projects
2. **Workspace Configuration**: `.pochi/config.jsonc` - Project-specific MCP servers that override or extend global settings

The workspace configuration takes precedence and is merged with the global configuration, allowing you to:

* Add project-specific MCP servers
* Override global server configurations for specific projects
* Maintain different MCP setups for different codebases

### Global MCP Configuration Example (`~/.pochi/config.jsonc`)

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/Users/yourname/Documents"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Workspace MCP Configuration Example (`.pochi/config.jsonc`)

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "project-db": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite", "./database.db"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "./src"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example:

* The `context7` server from global config will be available
* The workspace-specific `project-db` server will be added
* The `filesystem` server configuration will be overridden to only access the project's `src` directory

### Mistral

Mistral AI provides a range of powerful language models available through their API. To use Mistral models, you'll need to obtain an API key from [Mistral AI Platform](https://console.mistral.ai/).

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://getpochi.com/config.schema.json",
  "providers": {
    "mistral": {
      "apiKey": "your_api_key",
      "baseURL": "https://api.mistral.ai/v1",
      "models": {
        "mistral-small-latest": {
          "name": "mistral-small"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ollama

Ollama is a tool that allows you to run large language models locally on your machine with a simple API.

```json

# Permissions

By default, all permissions in Pochi are enabled. You can customize these permissions at any time using the Auto-Approve settings.

<div align="center">
  ![Auto Approve](../assets/images/auto-approve.png)
</div>

* **Read**: Read the file content Pochi decides to look up for analyzing or completing tasks.
* **Write**: Creates new files, edits existing code, generates boilerplate, and writes documentation.
* **Execute**: Manages dependencies, runs builds, tests, and perform system operations.
* **Use MCP**: Interacts with databases, APIs, and other external services to expand its capabilities with MCP server.
* **Retry**: Automatically retries failed commands, code changes, and installations.

# Queued Messages

The Queued Messages feature allows you to add multiple messages to a queue, which are then combined into a single prompt for execution. This lets you build up a complex request in pieces, which is especially useful while Pochi is busy.

<div align="center">
  ![Queued Messages UI](../assets/images/queued-messages.png)
</div>

When Pochi is busy, you don't have to wait to give it your next instruction. Here’s what happens:

1. **Queue with a Shortcut**: Type your prompt and press `Cmd+Enter` (`Ctrl+Enter` on Windows/Linux). Your message will be added directly to the queue.
2. **See What's in Line**: The "Queued Messages" panel appears, showing you a list of all the tasks waiting to be executed.
3. **Combined for Execution**: Once Pochi is ready, it will take all the messages from the queue, merge them into a single prompt, and then execute it.
4. **Remove with a Click**: If you decide you don't need a task done anymore, just click the `X` next to it to remove it from the queue.


# Rules

***

title: Rules
description: Define coding standards and development guidelines
icon: "Ruler"
-------------

# Rules

You can provide custom instructions to Pochi by creating an `README.pochi.md` file. This is similar to CLAUDE.md or Cursor’s rules.

<Callout title="AGENTS.md support">
  Pochi also supports [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) as an alternative to `README.pochi.md`. Both files serve the same purpose and are treated identically by Pochi.
</Callout>

### Example

Below example is the `README.pochi.md` file for Pochi itself.

```markdown
Pochi is an project developed using following technologies:
1. always use kebab-case for filenames.
2. always use camelCase for variables, functions.
3. use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types.

# Testing for non packages/vscode
We use vitest framework.
our test use vitest framework.
test command: `bun run test`
coverage test command: `bun run test -- --coverage`

## Testing for packages/vscode
We use mocha framework, when creating test, do not use mocks for filesystem, just use vscode.workspace.fs to create files and folders, and only use mocha primitives for testing. use sinon for mocks.

(assuming cwd is packages/vscode)
test command: `bun run test`
coverage test command: `bun run test:coverage`

When encountering issues like `TypeError: Descriptor for property readFile is non-configurable and non-writable`, please use `proxyquire` to mock the module.

# Misc
1. use `bun check` to format / linting the code, use `bun fix` to automatically apply the fix.
2. use `bun tsc` to check the types.
3. For packages/code it uses `ink` for react terminal ui.
4. Prefer `@/lib` over `../lib` for imports.
5. For global variable in typescript, prefer using PascalCase, e.g `GlobalVariableName`, instead of `GLOBAL_VARIABLE_NAME`.
6. For biome related warning / errors, prefer using `bun fix` in the root directory to fix the issues.
```

## Locations

Pochi looks for rules in two locations:

### Workspace

Pochi first checks for a `README.pochi.md` (or `AGENTS.md`) file in your current workspace root directory. This is where you define project-specific rules that apply only to your current project.

### Global

Pochi also reads global rules defined in `~/.pochi/README.pochi.md`. These rules apply to all projects and are suitable for any personal rules that Pochi should follow.

You can view current active rules in toolbar's token usage popover

Start tasks in Slack and seamlessly switch to the Cloud IDE when you need the full development experience.

<Callout type="info" title="Cloud IDE">
  When you send messages to Pochi in Slack, tasks are executed in remote environment running in the cloud. You can switch to the Cloud IDE to continue working on the task.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

### Adding Pochi to Your Workspace

1. **Install the Integration**: Add Pochi to your Slack workspace through the `Add to Slack` button on the [homepage](https://app.getpochi.com/home)
   ![Slack Installation](../assets/images/slack-install-home.png)
2. **Authorize Access**: Grant the necessary permissions for Pochi to interact with your Slack channels
   ![Slack Authorization](../assets/images/slack-authorize.png)
3. **Start Collaborating**: Begin using Pochi in any channel or direct message where it's been added. If using channels, please make sure to invite Pochi to the channel before creating a task.

### Basic Usage

Once Pochi is added to your workspace:

1. \[Optional] **Invite Pochi to Channels**: If you want to interact with Pochi in channels, simply send `@Pochi` in the channel, and you will be prompted to invite Pochi to the channel.
2. \[Optional] **Default Github Repository**: Set the repository in the Channel Topic, so Pochi knows which repository to work on by default.
   * Format: `[repo:OWNER/REPO]`, for example, `[repo:TabbyML/pochi]`
3. **Start Task**: Send a task prompt to Pochi in Direct Messages or channels using the following format:
   * If a default repository is set: `/newtask PROMPT`, for example, `/newtask What are recent commits`
   * If no default repository is set or you want to run Pochi with another repository : `/newtask [OWNER/REPO] PROMPT`, for example, `/newtask [TabbyML/tabby] What are recent commits`
4. **Real-time Updates**: Watch as Pochi executes tasks and provides updates directly in Slack.
5. **Follow-up**: After the task is completed, Pochi might ask some follow-up questions, or you can provide responses clicking the option buttons or the Reply button.

![Slack Task](../assets/images/slack-task.png)

### Continue in Cloud IDE

When you need the full IDE experience:

1. **Access Task Page**: Click on the `See Details` button to navigate to the task in Pochi's web interface.
2. **Click Remote Icon**: Look for the remote/external link icon in the task interface.

# Tab Completion

**Tab Completion** is Pochi's in-editor inline code completion feature that provides AI-powered suggestions as you type, helping you write code faster and more efficiently.

Pochi uses a state-of-the-art model that adapts to your coding patterns in real time,
drawing on recent edits, diagnostics, and surrounding context to generate helpful,
relevant completions right in your editor.

<div align="center">
  ![Tab completion showing inline suggestions](../assets/images/completion.png)
</div>

### Multi-Language Support

Works across popular programming languages including:

* JavaScript/TypeScript
* Python
* Java
* C/C++
* Go
* Rust
* And many more

## Using Tab Completion

### Basic Usage

1. Start typing your code
2. Pochi will show inline suggestions in gray text
3. Press `Tab` to accept the suggestion
4. Press `Escape` to dismiss the suggestion

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key            | Action                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`          | Accept the current suggestion               |
| `Escape`       | Dismiss the suggestion                      |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + →` | Accept word by word                         |
| `Alt + ]`      | Next suggestion (if multiple available)     |
| `Alt + [`      | Previous suggestion (if multiple available) |

## Tab Completion Model Settings

You can customize the code completion provider in your VS Code settings, allowing you to switch between different models, including those running on your local machine.

By default, Pochi uses its own hosted code completion model. Alternatively, you can configure Pochi to use any OpenAI-compatible server that provides a Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) completion model.

Here is an example configuration for a local OpenAI-compatible server running `qwen3-coder-30b-a3b` on port 8000:

```json
  "pochi.advanced": {
    "inlineCompletion": {
      "provider": {
        "type": "openai",
        "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1",
        "apiKey": "",
        "model": "qwen3-coder-30b-a3b",
        "promptTemplate": "<|fim_prefix|>{{prefix}}<|fim_suffix|>{{suffix}}<|fim_middle|>"
      }
    }
  },
```

* **baseURL**: The base URL of the OpenAI-compatible server.
* **apiKey**: The API key for the server. If not set, Pochi will use the `POCHI_CODE_COMPLETION_OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. This can be left empty if the server does not require an API key.
* **model**: The name of the FIM completion model to use.
* **promptTemplate**: The prompt template for FIM completion. It must include `{{prefix}}` and `{{suffix}}` placeholders.

-----------------------

# VS Code

This page covers the core Pochi experience in VS Code, from installation and setup to the main chat and task management features.

## Installation

Install the Pochi extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabbyML.pochi) or [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/TabbyML/pochi).

For the best experience, we recommend dragging the Pochi view to the right sidebar to use it side-by-side with your editor.

![Drag the Pochi view to the right sidebar for a side-by-side experience.](../assets/images/vscode-right-sidebar.png)

## Welcome

Upon first launch, Pochi's Welcome page offers two ways to get started:

* **Sign in to Pochi:** Click "Sign In" and authorize in your browser to use Pochi subscriptions, models, and cloud features.
* **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK):** Use your own models by running `Pochi: Open Custom Model Settings` from the Command Palette. This opens `~/.pochi/config.jsonc` for you to add API keys. See [Models](/models) for details.

<div align="center">![The Welcome page provides options to sign in or configure your own models.](../assets/images/welcome-page.png)</div>

## Chat

Access the Pochi chat panel via the Activity Bar icon or shortcut (macOS: `Cmd+L`, Win/Linux: `Ctrl+L`). This is your main interface for interacting with Pochi. **Note:** An active workspace (i.e., an open folder) is required to use the chat.

The panel's title bar includes actions for starting a new task and viewing all tasks.

<div align="center">![The main Chat panel is where you interact with Pochi.](../assets/images/chat-page.png)</div>

## Prompting

The input box, located below the chat history, is where you'll compose your messages and control the chat.

* **Auto-Approve Menu:** This menu at the top of the zone allows you to grant Pochi permission to use tools autonomously, streamlining the workflow.
* **Todo List:** When Pochi creates a to-do list for a task, it will appear here, allowing you to track progress.
* **Chat Input:** The main text area supports both text and image uploads. You can attach files by clicking the **paperclip icon** or by dragging and dropping them into the input area.
* **Bottom Toolbar:** The toolbar at the very bottom provides several key functions:
  * **Model Selector:** Choose which language model you want to interact with.
  * **Token Usage & Compact Task:** Monitor the token count of your conversation. If the conversation becomes long, a **Compact Task** button will appear, allowing you to condense the history and save tokens.
  * **Sharing:** Share your chat session with others (requires a Pochi account).
  * **Submit/Stop Button:** The send button dynamically transforms into a stop button during message generation, allowing you to interrupt the AI at any time.

<div align="center">
  ![The Prompt Zone provides access to key features like model selection and auto-approval.](../assets/images/home-page-toolbox.png)
</div>

## Tasks

A chat session in Pochi is saved as a **Task**. You can view your entire task history from the task list page.

Some AI-powered actions might generate a **Sub-task**, which is a new, focused chat session dedicated to a specific part of the original task.
When you're in a sub-task, you'll see a "Back" button to navigate to the parent task, allowing you to maintain context while breaking down complex problems.
By default sub-tasks are hidden in the task list.

By default, task history is stored locally. Signing in to a Pochi account enables cloud storage for your tasks, along with sharing and team collaboration features.
Be aware that clearing VS Code's extension data may erase your local task history.

<div align="center">![The Task List page shows your historical task sessions.](../assets/images/task-page.png)</div>

## Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are a few things to check:

* **No Active Workspace:** Pochi requires an open folder to function correctly. Make sure you have a workspace open.
* **Sign-in/Model Configuration:** Verify that you are either signed in to your Pochi account or have a valid API key configured in your `~/.pochi/config.jsonc`.

# Workflows

Automate common development sequences
***

title: Workflows
description: Automate common development sequences
icon: "Workflow"
----------------

# Workflows

Workflows are step-by-step automation templates that guide Pochi through complex, multi-step processes. Think of them as detailed recipes that Pochi can follow to complete common development tasks consistently and efficiently.

### Configure

Workflows shall be put inside `.pochi/workflows/` directory in your workspace root. Each workflow is a markdown file with a specific name. You can also specify metadata, such as which model to use for the workflow, through YAML frontmatter.

`.pochi/workflows/create-pr.md` is an example we used in Pochi's own development.

```markdown
---
model: "anthropic/claude-4-sonnet"
---

Please help create a PR for the current staging changes, following these guidelines:
- If there are no staging changes but there are uncommitted changes, please stage them first.
- Create a branch name based on the current git diff status.
- Write a meaningful commit message/PR title.
- Use the gh CLI to create a PR.
- When running the push operation, it might be aborted due to a husky pre-push hook. For formatting issues, amend the files and try again. For other issues, try to resolve them as much as possible.
- The base branch for the PR should always be `main`.
- Always push the branch to the remote repository before creating the PR.

When creating PR with markdown description, pay attention to escape backticks, otherwise it will be executed as command substitution in the shell.
```

### Usage

Once your workflows are set up, using them is straightforward:

1. **Type `/` in VS Code** to trigger the Pochi workflow selector
2. **Select a workflow** from the dropdown menu and press `Enter`.
3. You can attached additional context when running the workflow, e.g `/create-pr assign Meng for review after creation`.

<div
  style={{
  position: "relative",
  paddingBottom: "53.7%",

# Weekly Update #5

### TL;DR

This release introduces a manual sub-task execution mode for more control over sensitive workflows. We’ve also added MCP support in the CLI, enabled GitHub Copilot and Claude Pro/Max authentication, and shipped new tutorials and key security and stability improvements. 🙌

### 🚀 Features

* **Manual Execution Mode for Sub-Tasks:** Sub-tasks created with `newTask` can now be run in a manual, step-by-step mode avoiding large unmoderated changes to your codebases in your sensitive workflows. **[#300](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/300)**

  <div class="w-12/15 md:ml-8 *:shadow-xl/30 *:rounded-lg">![Claude Support](./images/claude-copilot-support.png)</div>

* **Improved VS Code Configuration Navigation:** VS Code commands like `Pochi: Open MCP Server Settings` now open the relevant config file and jump directly to the specific setting, **[#301](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/301)**

### ✨ Enhancements

* **Enhanced Gemini Model Support:** We've improved existing image input capabilities with added PDF and video inputs, providing richer multimodal workflows with Gemini models. **[#219](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/219)**

* **Malformed Custom Agents in VSCode Settings:** Previously ignored malformed agent files (e.g., with YAML parsing errors) are now displayed in the settings UI with a clear warning, making it easier to debug and fix broken custom agent configurations. **[#391](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/391)**, **[#415](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/415)**

# Connect to Tabby Server for Enhanced Enterprise Experience

This tutorial will guide you through the process of connecting Pochi to your self-hosted Tabby server. By connecting Pochi to your self-hosted Tabby server, you can take advantage of several benefits, including centralized account management, self-hosted tracking, and the ability to use your own custom models.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have a running Tabby server instance. If you don't have one, you can follow the instructions on the [Tabby website](https://tabby.tabbyml.com/) to set one up.

## Configuration

Pochi uses a configuration file to connect to different model providers. To connect to Tabby, you'll need to add a new provider configuration to your `~/.pochi/config.json` file.

Here's a sample configuration for connecting to a Tabby server:

```jsonc
{
    "kind": "openai",
    "id": "tabby",
    "baseURL": "https://demo.tabbyml.com/v1",
    "apiKey": "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN",
    "models": [
        {
            "id": "default",
            // This flag is important for Tabby to work properly with Pochi
            "useToolCallMiddleware": true
        }
    ]
}
```

### Parameters

You'll need to change the following parameters in the configuration:

* `baseURL`: Change this to the URL of your Tabby server instance.
* `apiKey`: Change this to your own auth token from the Tabby UI. You can find your token in the "Token" section of the Tabby admin panel, as shown in the screenshot below.

<div align="center">
  ![Tabby Auth Token](./images/tabby-auth-token.png)
</div>

## Conclusion

Once you have updated the configuration file, Pochi will be able to connect to your Tabby server and use the models you have configured.

# Voice-Driven Development with Hex and Pochi

This tutorial guides you through setting up an efficient, voice-driven development workflow by combining two powerful tools: **[Hex](https://github.com/kitlangton/Hex)** for local voice transcription and **[Pochi](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi)** as your AI coding assistant.

This setup allows you to speak commands, have them transcribed into text by Hex, and then have Pochi execute those commands, creating a seamless, hands-free coding experience.

### What You Will Learn

* How to install and configure Hex for voice-to-text transcription.
* How to integrate Hex with Pochi to create a voice-driven development workflow.
* Tips for optimizing your setup for accuracy and efficiency.

### Prerequisites

* **Pochi**: You should have Pochi installed and running in your editor.
* **Apple Silicon Mac**: Hex is currently available only for Macs with Apple Silicon.

### How It Works

* **Hex** listens to your voice and converts it into text using its own built-in transcription models.
* **Pochi** takes the text generated by Hex as a command and processes it using its configured AI model.

> **For a Fully Private Workflow**
> This tutorial focuses on the voice input aspect. For complete privacy and offline use, you can configure Pochi to use a local Large Language Model (LLM). See Pochi's documentation on [model configuration](../../models) for more details.

***

## Step 1: Install and Configure Hex

Hex is an open-source macOS app that records your voice via a hotkey and pastes the transcribed text into any application.

1. **Download Hex**: Get the latest version from the [official releases page](https://hex-updates.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hex-latest.dmg).

2. **Install and Grant Permissions**:
   * Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag Hex into your `Applications` folder.
   * On first launch, macOS will ask for **Microphone** and **Accessibility** permissions. You must grant these so Hex can record your voice and paste the text into Pochi's chat window.

3. **Configure Hex Settings**:
   Once installed, open Hex's preferences to fine-tune its behavior.

   **A. Set Your Hotkey**
   This is the key you'll press to activate Hex. Choose a key or combination that doesn't conflict with other apps. The `Ignore below` slider helps prevent accidental triggers from very short key presses.

   ![Hex Hotkey Setting](./images/hotkey-setting.png)

   Hex also supports two recording modes:

   * **Press-and-hold**: Start recording when you press the hotkey, and stop when you release it.
   * **Double-tap**: Double-tap the hotkey to lock recording, then tap it again to stop.

   **B. Select Your Transcription Model**
   Hex uses local models based on [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) to ensure privacy and speed. You can choose a model that balances accuracy and performance for your needs.

   ![Hex Transcription Model Settings](./images/transcription-model-setting.png)

   * **Model Size**: Larger models (like `Large` at 1.5GB) offer higher accuracy but are slower and consume more resources. The `Small` model is faster but may be less accurate. A good starting point is the `Large` model if you prioritize accuracy.
   * **Output Language**: You can select the language for your transcription, which is useful if you prefer to give commands in a language other than English.

> **Note**: The first time you select a model, Hex will download and compile it. A process called `ANECompilerService` may cause high CPU usage during this one-time optimization step. This is normal.

## Step 2: The Voice Coding Workflow in Action

With Hex installed, let's try the workflow.

1. **Open Pochi**: Launch Pochi's chat interface in your code editor.

2. **Activate Hex**: Click inside Pochi's input box, then use the hotkey you configured for Hex. When Hex is actively listening, it will display a recording indicator on your screen.

   ![Hex Recording Indicator](./images/recording-indicator.png)

3. **Speak Your Command**: Clearly state the task you want Pochi to perform. For example:
   > Write a TypeScript function that takes an array of strings and returns the longest one.

4. **Transcription**: When you stop recording, Hex transcribes your speech and pastes the text into Pochi's input box.

5. **Execution**: Pochi takes this text and sends it to its configured AI model for processing. The generated code or response appears in the chat.

## Tips and Troubleshooting

* **Inaccurate Transcription?**
  In Hex settings, try selecting a larger transcription model for better accuracy.

* **Need Help with Hex?**
  For questions or feedback specifically about Hex, join their [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5UzVCqWmav).

## Conclusion

By combining Hex and Pochi, you've created a fast and efficient voice-powered programming environment. This setup gives you a modern, hands-free way to translate your ideas into code.

# Visualizing the Dialogue: How Pochi Uses Mermaid Graphs to Communicate

When Pochi tackles a large-scale code change, a monologue of text and code is not an effective way to collaborate. To have a clear dialogue with you, Pochi translates its plans into **Mermaid graphs**.

Think of these diagrams as Pochi's whiteboard, where it sketches out its ideas for you to review. It's a communication tool designed to turn a complex plan into a simple, visual conversation. This allows you to understand, approve, and guide Pochi's approach before it writes a single line of code.

## A Visual Conversation for Complex Tasks

Pochi automatically generates Mermaid graphs when it needs to discuss its plan for complex tasks, such as:

* **Architectural Changes**: Showing how the overall structure of your application will be modified.
* **Complex Refactoring**: Breaking down a large function or class into smaller pieces.
* **New Feature Implementation**: Visualizing how a new feature will interact with existing components.

## Example: Pochi Proposes a Complex Refactor

When preparing for a significant refactoring, Pochi uses a diagram to discuss the proposed architecture with you. In this example, Pochi was asked to refactor a component for Server-Side Rendering (SSR). It first analyzed the code, then generated the following diagram to explain its findings and get your feedback.

![Tool Invocation Architecture](./images/tool-invocation-architecture.png)

This diagram provides a clear overview of the system, which was then used to formulate a refactoring plan. The analysis highlighted several key areas:

### Core Components:

* **ToolInvocationPart**: The main entry point that routes tools to the correct renderer.
* **Tools Registry**: A static mapping of tool names to their corresponding React components.
* **McpToolCall**: A specialized renderer for tools using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
* **Shared UI Components**: A library of reusable components like containers, icons, and badges.

### SSR Challenges Identified:

The diagram helped identify three major challenges for implementing SSR:

1. **Client-Side State Dependencies**: Heavy reliance on React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`) and context providers for managing the tool lifecycle, which are not available on the server.
2. **Browser/Environment Dependencies**: Components with direct dependencies on browser-specific features like `XTerm.js`, VS Code APIs, and file system interactions.
3. **Dynamic Component Resolution**: The architecture relies on a runtime tool registry and conditional rendering based on the tool's execution state, which is difficult to resolve on the server.

By visualizing the architecture, Pochi enabled the user to quickly understand the problem and approve the proposed strategy.

## Example: Pochi Clarifies Business Logic with a Flowchart

For changes to business logic, a code diff can be hard to follow. Pochi uses flowcharts to walk you through the new logic step-by-step. When asked to modify a task persistence feature, Pochi generated this flowchart to explain the new process.

![Task Persistence Flowchart](./images/persist-task-flow.png)

This visual explanation makes it much easier to verify the correctness of the new logic:

1. **Time Check**: The process starts with a throttling mechanism to prevent spamming the API.
2. **API Call**: If the check passes, it queries messages and calls the persistence API.
3. **Error Handling**: It includes a clear path for what happens if the API call fails.
4. **State Update**: It shows how the local state is updated with a `shareId` upon success.

This turns a code review into a collaborative check of the logic, ensuring you and Pochi are on the same page.

## Conclusion: Your Dialogue with Pochi

Mermaid graphs are more than just diagrams; they are the bridge for communication between you and Pochi. They transform a potential monologue of code into a clear, interactive dialogue about the best path forward.

When you see Pochi generate a Mermaid graph, it's an invitation to collaborate. Take a moment to review it—your feedback is crucial for guiding the AI and ensuring the final result meets your exact expectations.

And remember, this is a two-way conversation. If you ever feel that Pochi's plan is unclear, you can proactively ask it to generate a Mermaid graph. Just say, "Can you explain that with a Mermaid diagram?" This puts you in control, allowing you to request visual clarity whenever you need it.

# Build a Custom MCP Server to Query Supabase

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to build a custom MCP server in Pochi that lets you run natural language SQL queries on your Supabase database. This lets you query your database directly from your code editor using everyday language, making complex SQL queries simple and intuitive.

This is a practical example of extending Pochi using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and illustrates how teams can integrate AI into internal workflows for powerful, context-aware automation. This is particularly useful when you're debugging code, collaborating across teams, or building features that require quick access to live data (e.g: checking whether a migration seeded correctly, inspecting a table schema, or verifying specific column values).

### Prerequisites

Before we start, you’ll need the following:

* **[Install Pochi](https://docs.getpochi.com/#installation)**
* **[Setup a Supabase Project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/)**
* **[OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/)**  (You can use any other LLM model if preferred.)

## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a lightweight, flexible interface that allows large language models (LLMs) like those used in Pochi to connect and interact with external tools, APIs, or databases. In this tutorial, **[MCP](https://docs.getpochi.com/mcp/)** acts as the bridge between your natural language queries and the Supabase database, enabling Pochi to translate plain English questions into SQL queries using OpenAI, execute them, and even generate visualizations using Vega Charts.

![Architectural Diagram](./images/mcp-server-supabase-diagram.png)

We’re going to use Supabase database and limit to read only queries, but you can always extend to perform CRUD operations too. Using MCP servers makes it easy to extend AI assistants with custom functionality and is a perfect way to keep your focus on coding while still getting the data context you need.

## Getting Started: How to Build the MCP Server

### Step 1: Setup your VS Code project

First, we’ll set up a new project inside VS Code. To do so, we’ll create a new folder and initialise a Node project.

```bash
mkdir supabase-mcp-server
cd supabase-mcp-server
npm init -y
```

The command `npm init -y` quickly creates a `package.json` file in your project directory using default values, without prompting you for configuration.

Once the project is setup, we need to install the required dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod openai dotenv @supabase/supabase-js
```

* `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` – Provides tools to manage structured context and memory for LLMs.
* `zod` – Required to define schemas for input/output in the MCP SDK.
* `openai` – Used to interact with OpenAI’s language and image models.
* `dotenv` – Loads environment variables from a .env file into the app.
* `@supabase/supabase-js` – Enables database, auth, and storage operations with Supabase.

### Create a `.env` file

The `.env` file is created to store your Supabase and OpenAI keys to avoid exposing them on the code side. You can fetch your Supabase API key by going to Settings -> API keys and creating a secret service role API key.
![API Keys Supabase Dashboard](./images/api-keys-supabase-dashboard.png)

For the OpenAI key, go to your **[dashboard and API keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)** section where you can click `+Create a secret key` button on the top right corner.
![OpenAI Dashboard](./images/openai-dashboard.png)

Paste these keys in the `.env` file as follows:

```jsonc
SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### Step 2: Create your Supabase Database

You can create a database table by going to Database -> Tables -> New Table. Add the relevant `Name`, `Description` and `Column` types you want or import via a CSV.

![Create Supabase Table](./images/create-supabase-table.png)

What we’ll do here instead is to open the SQL editor and create a database by running the below query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales_data (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE NOT NULL,
    region TEXT NOT NULL,
    product TEXT NOT NULL,
    sales_amount NUMERIC(12,2) NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

This creates a `sales_data` table with columns for `id`, `sale_date`, `region`, `product`, `sales_amount`, and `quantity`. To insert values into this database you can again do it manually, or via SQL insertion as below:

```sql
INSERT INTO sales_data (id, sale_date, region, product, sales_amount, quantity) VALUES
('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', '2024-01-01', 'North America', 'Smartphone', 120345.50, 350),
('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440048', '2024-01-02', 'Europe', 'Laptop', 98000.00, 220),
('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003', '2024-01-03', 'Asia', 'Tablet', 45000.75, 180),
('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440004', '2024-01-04', 'South America', 'Smartwatch', 25000.00, 90),
(Include the rest of your rows here)
```

This is how your database table will look:
![Final Supabase Table](./images/table-final-supabase.png)

### Step 3: Prompt Pochi to build out the MCP server & Supabase Client

You can generate your MCP server in minutes by prompting Pochi to create the required files. Here’s a prompt you can use:

```
Create a new project for an MCP server that connects to Supabase. I need three files:
- `supabaseClient.js` for initializing the Supabase client using environment variables
- `index.js` for the MCP server with a queryDatabase tool that takes a plain-English question, translates it into SQL with OpenAI, runs it on Supabase, and outputs results and a Vega-Lite chart
- `.env` showing what env vars are needed.”

Transport
- Use `StdioServerTransport` from MCP SDK.
- The server must run as a subprocess and communicate with Pochi/Inspector via stdio.

Error Handling
- Always return `success: true|false`.
- On error, return `{ success: false, rows: [], error: "<message>" }`.

```

Here’s the generated `supabaseClient.js` file:

```javascript
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const supabaseUrl = process.env.SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY;

if (!supabaseKey) {
  console.error("❌ Missing SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY env var");
  throw new Error("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variable is required");
}

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey, {
  auth: { persistSession: false, autoRefreshToken: false },
  global: {
    headers: { "User-Agent": "mcp-supabase-server/1.0.0" },
  },
});
```

**Note:** Pochi comes with built-in support for various LLM providers. This grants flexibility, as not every model behaves the same way. Some are ideal for code generation, while some do logical reasoning better and often switching models is enough to break out of an error loop you might be stuck in.

There is also the option to “Bring Your Own Key” (BYOK), if you’re working on large codebases with a team that requires unlimited usage, wants to log and bill everything in their own OpenAI account, or if you need access to models beyond what Pochi provides by default. For this tutorial, we’ll stick with the default setup but you can read more about this **[here](https://docs.getpochi.com/models/)**.

![BYOK or use supported models](./images/byok-pochi.png)

Also, It’s important to define your database schema in order for OpenAI to create the proper SQL queries. Otherwise, the SQL generated will keep referencing new table and column names which would fail with “No \[database / column name] found" since they don’t exist.

In your prompt to Pochi you can define the database schema as such:

```
You must ONLY use this schema:
Table: sales_data
- id (uuid)
- sale_date (date)
- region (text)
- product (text)
- sales_amount (numeric)
- quantity (integer)
```

Here’s the complete `index.js` file that was generated:

````javascript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { supabase } from "./supabaseClient.js";
import { z } from "zod";
import OpenAI from "openai";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

// Known schema description (from your DB)
const schemaDescription = `
You must ONLY use this schema:
Table: sales_data
- id (uuid)
- sale_date (date)
- region (text)
- product (text)
- sales_amount (numeric)
- quantity (integer)
`;

// Helper: build Vega-Lite spec automatically
function buildVegaLiteSpec(rows) {
  if (!rows || rows.length === 0) return null;
  const sample = rows[0];
  const keys = Object.keys(sample);

  let xKey = keys.find(
    (k) =>
      typeof sample[k] === "string" ||
      k.toLowerCase().includes("date") ||
      k.toLowerCase().includes("region") ||
      k.toLowerCase().includes("product")
  );
  let yKey = keys.find(
    (k) =>
      typeof sample[k] === "number" ||
      k.toLowerCase().includes("amount") ||
      k.toLowerCase().includes("quantity") ||
      k.toLowerCase().includes("total")
  );

  if (!xKey || !yKey) return null;

  return {
    $schema: "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json",
    description: `Auto-generated chart of ${yKey} by ${xKey}`,
    data: { values: rows },
    mark: "bar",
    encoding: {
      x: { field: xKey, type: "ordinal" },
      y: { field: yKey, type: "quantitative" },
    },
  };
}

// Create MCP server
const server = new McpServer({

    ]),

  },
  async (input) => {
    try {
      let question = "";

      // 🔑 Normalize input from different runtimes
      if (typeof input === "string") {
        question = input;
      } else if (input?.question) {
        question = input.question;
      } else if (typeof input?.inputSchema === "string") {
        try {
          const parsed = JSON.parse(input.inputSchema);
          if (parsed.question) question = parsed.question;
        } catch {
          // ignore parse errors
        }
      } else if (input?.inputSchema?.question) {
        question = input.inputSchema.question;
      }

      if (!question.trim()) {
        return { success: false, rows: [], error: "No question provided" };
      }

      // 🚀 Translate English → SQL
      const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4.1",
        messages: [
          {
            role: "system",
            content: `You are an assistant that translates plain English into SQL queries for PostgreSQL.

        temperature: 0,
      });

      const sqlRaw = completion.choices[0].message.content.trim();
      console.error("Generated SQL (raw):", sqlRaw);

      const sqlMatch = sqlRaw.match(/```(?:sql)?\s*([\s\S]*?)\s*```/i);
      const sql = (sqlMatch ? sqlMatch[1] : sqlRaw).replace(/;$/, "").trim();

      console.error("Final SQL:", sql);

      if (!/^select/i.test(sql)) {
        return {
          success: false,
          rows: [],
          error: "Generated SQL is not a SELECT statement",
          sql,
        };
      }

      const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc("exec_sql", {
        sql_query: sql,
      });

      if (error) {
        return {
          success: false,
          rows: [],
          error: `SQL execution failed: ${error.message}`,
          sql,
        };
      }

      const rows = Array.isArray(data) ? data : [];
      const vega = buildVegaLiteSpec(rows);

      const content = vega
        ? [
            {
              type: "chart",
              format: "vega-lite",
              data: vega,
            },
          ]
        : [];

      return { success: true, rows, vega, content, sql };
    } catch (err) {
      return {
        success: false,
        rows: [],
        error: String(err.message || err),
      };
    }
  }
);

// Transport
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();

// Connect the server and handle potential errors
server.connect(transport).catch((error) => {
  console.error("Connection error:", error);
  process.exit(1);
});

process.on("SIGINT", () => process.exit(0));
process.on("SIGTERM", () => process.exit(0));

console.error("✅ Supabase MCP server running (STDIO, NL → SQL enabled)");
````

#### Writing the `exec_sql` function

In the `index.js` file, you’d notice the following code:

```jsonc
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc("exec_sql", { sql_query });
```

This allows your MCP server to send queries to Supabase. When the server calls the code above, it sends your generated SQL string to the `exec_sql` function in Supabase, which executes it on the server and returns the results as JSON

Now, Supabase does not support executing SQL directly through the client SDK. To make this work, we need to create an `exec_sql` RPC function in Supabase editor. Here’s the code you need to execute:

```sql
create or replace function exec_sql(sql text)
returns setof json as $$
begin
  return query execute sql;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;
```

![Exectue RPC function](./images/exec-function-supabase-dashboard.png)

### Step 4: Configure Pochi to add your MCP server config

In your VS Code, press `Command + Shift + P` on Mac, or `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and open the `Pochi: Open MCP Server Settings`. Here, you need to add your MCP server config. Initially it is empty:

```jsonc
“mcp": {}
```

Paste this JSON snippet inside the existing MCP config :

```jsonc
"mcp": {
    "my-supabase-mcp": {
      "command": "/Users/apple/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.0/bin/node",
      "args": [
        "index.js"
      ],
      "cwd": "/Users/apple/Documents/supabase-mcp-server"
    }
  }
```

The above code snippet will register a local MCP server in Pochi.

* `command` = This is the path to the Node.js executable you want to use.
* `args` = The actual MCP server package or script to run (which we will generate in Step 6)
* `cwd` = The current working directory where the command will run.

When you save this config in the `~/config.json` file, Pochi will know to launch `node index.js` as a subprocess and communicate with it via stdio transport when the “my-supabase-mcp” server is enabled. Read more about it **[here](https://docs.getpochi.com/mcp/)**.

### Step 5: Testing the MCP Server

Now that our server is created, we can test it using the MCP Inspector. The inspector is a way to verify the tools and resources exposed by the server work as expected. To do that first we install the MCP Inspector

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Then you need to run  your MCP server in Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node index.js
```

(make sure you’re in your project folder, in this case: `supabase-mcp-server`).

Open the Inspector in your browser (it launches a local port).

* You’ll see a UI showing your server name (\`supabase-mcp\`\`).
* Under “Tools” you should see \`querySupabaseSQL\`\`.
* Click it, pass in your input:

```jsonc
{"question":"What are the total sales of each product by region?"}
```

You should see the correct response which includes the Supabase database query result and a Vega Lite JSON spec.

#### Enable your MCP server

Now that your MCP server is verified, you can enable it inside Pochi to use it in your editor’s natural language chat UI. For that, we need to go to Pochi’s Tools Settings page (you can also find it via Command Palette: `Pochi: Open Tools Settings`)

Look for the MCP server named `my-supabase-mcp` and toggle it ON (enabled). You should see a green dot to indicate its connected.

    allowFullScreen
    title="Enable MCP Server in Pochi"
  />
</div>

### Step 6: Executing the MCP server in Pochi

Once it works in Inspector, we can connect it into Pochi (our config already points to `index.js`). Then when you give Pochi a natural language prompt,  asking the model to call `queryDatabase` tool, it will answer all your database related queries easily.

Prompt used:

> Use the `queryDatabase` tool to find out what are the total sales for each product by region

Here’s the final working demo:

You can also paste in the Vega - Lite JSON spec you receive in response into the Vega Editor and get a chart response of the requested query:

## Step 7 (Optional): Using the MCP Server with Pochi CLI

So far, we’ve tested our Supabase MCP server in the Inspector, wired it into the Pochi VS Code extension, and also tested via the Pochi chat UI. But Pochi also provides a **[CLI client](https://docs.getpochi.com/cli/)** that can connect to MCP servers directly from your terminal.

This means you can query your database without opening VS Code at all:

```bash
pochi -p "What are the total sales for Europe region?"
```

Behind the scenes, the Pochi CLI works the same way as the VS Code extension: it connects to your MCP server via `stdio`, calls the `queryDatabas`e tool, and streams the results back into your terminal.

<div
  style={{
  position: "relative",
  paddingBottom: "53.7%",
  marginBottom: 20,
  height: 0,
  overflow: "hidden",
  maxWidth: "100%",
}}
>

    style={{
    position: "absolute",
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
    border: "none",
    borderRadius: "8px",
  }}
    allowFullScreen
    title="Executing MCP server via CLI"
  />
</div>

Invoking via the CLI helps if you spend most of your time in the shell or on remote servers. It also works great over SSH, in Docker containers, or CI/CD pipelines where you don’t have an editor UI. Moreover, you can use in automation workflows by wrapping `pochi -p` commands in scripts to periodically check metrics.

## Conclusion: Improving Developer Workflow for Teams and Enterprises

Whether you're querying user logs, verifying migrations, or building internal dashboards, MCP lets you build custom servers that connect Pochi to your unique internal tools and workflows. This Supabase MCP server is just one example of how Pochi’s powerful extensibility can help your team stay in flow, access real-time context, and reduce the friction of internal data access.

Now that you’ve seen what’s possible, here are a few ways to take your project further:

* **Deploy your MCP server with HTTP Transport**: Instead of running locally via stdio, you can deploy your server over HTTP. This enables multiple team members. from developers to engineering managers, to securely access the same database instance through Pochi, with proper access controls, rate limiting, and centralized schema management. **[Learn more](https://docs.getpochi.com/mcp/#remote-mcp-servers-http-transport)**
* **Expand beyond read-only queries**: This tutorial focused on read-only queries for simplicity, but you can extend your MCP server to support full CRUD operations, allowing your natural language interface to create, update, and delete records as well.
* **Customize and optimize prompts**: Experiment with prompt design for OpenAI to improve SQL accuracy or add support for additional data visualizations beyond Vega Lite charts.
* **Contribute and share**: If you built something cool or want to see tutorials on related topics, such as CRUD operations or deployment best practices, please reach out by using `/create-issue command` within the Pochi VS Code extension or **[contribute to the project](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi?tab=contributing-ov-file)**!
