## Installation

Install the Pochi extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabbyML.pochi) or [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/TabbyML/pochi).

We recommend dragging Pochi to the right side of your VSCode window to get the best experience.

![Drag to right sidebar](../assets/images/vscode-right-sidebar.png)

With Pochi, you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys. Use the VS Code command `Pochi: Open Custom Model Settings` to open the settings file and [configure it](./models). Alternatively, Pochi offers cloud-based services. Creating a Pochi account gives you access to:

* Pochi's managed LLM models
* Shared task histories and team management
* Integrations with GitHub and Slack for a collaborative workflow

To use these features, sign up at [app.getpochi.com](http://app.getpochi.com) and log in to your VS Code extension.

## Customize

And that's it! You're ready to start using Pochi now!

# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** revolutionizes how Pochi interacts with external services, databases, and APIs. Think of MCP as a universal adapter that connects Pochi to virtually any data source or tool, dramatically expanding what your AI assistant can accomplish.

## Configure

Use the VSCode command `Pochi: Open MCP Server Settings` to open the settings.

```json
{
  "pochi.mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

After saving the configuration, you will see the MCP server appear in the **Tools** section of Pochi's settings page.

![MCP Server Context7](../assets/images/mcp-context7.png)

You can use the toggle switch to enable or disable the MCP server entirely. You can also click on the tool badge to toggle individual tools within the MCP server.

## Examples

### Local MCP Servers (Stdio Transport)

```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
      "/path/to/allowed/files"
    ],
    "env": {
      "HOME": "/Users/yourname"
    }
  }
}
```

### Remote MCP Servers (HTTP Transport)

#### Custom API Server

```json
{
  "my-api": {
    "url": "https://api.mycompany.com/mcp",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-token",
      "X-API-Version": "v1"
    }
  }
}
```

#### SSE (Server-Sent Events) Server

```json
{
  "realtime-data": {
    "url": "https://data.example.com/mcp/sse",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer your-token"
    }
  }

## GitHub Copilot Models

For Microsoft VS Code distributions, you can utilize your enabled Copilot models within Pochi.

![Copilot Models](../assets/images/copilot-models.png)

## OpenAI Compatible Models

Pochi allows you to configure any LLM provider that offers an OpenAI-compatible API by setting up the appropriate API keys. To configure custom models, use the VS Code command `Pochi: Open Custom Model Settings` to open the settings configuration file.

```json
{
  "id": "groq",
  "apiKey": "your_api_key",
  "baseUrl": "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1",
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct",
      "contextWindow": 131072,
      "maxTokens": 8000
    }
  ]
}
```

After saving the configuration, the model will be available in the toolbar's model selector.

# Permissions

By default, all permissions in Pochi are enabled. You can customize these permissions at any time using the Auto-Approve settings.

<p align="center">
  ![Auto Approve](../assets/images/auto-approve.png)
</p>

* **Read**: Read the file content Pochi decides to look up for analyzing or completing tasks.
* **Write**: Creates new files, edits existing code, generates boilerplate, and writes documentation.
* **Execute**: Manages dependencies, runs builds, tests, and perform system operations.
* **Use MCP**: Interacts with databases, APIs, and other external services to expand its capabilities with MCP server.
* **Retry**: Automatically retries failed commands, code changes, and installations.


# Rules

***

title: Rules
description: Define coding standards and development guidelines
icon: "Ruler"
-------------

# Rules

You can provide custom instructions to Pochi by creating an `README.pochi.md` file. This is similar to CLAUDE.md or Cursor’s rules.

<Callout title="AGENTS.md support">
  Pochi also supports [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) as an alternative to `README.pochi.md`. Both files serve the same purpose and are treated identically by Pochi.
</Callout>

### Example

Below example is the `README.pochi.md` file for Pochi itself.

```markdown
Pochi is an project developed using following technologies:
1. always use kebab-case for filenames.
2. always use camelCase for variables, functions.
3. use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types.

# Testing for non packages/vscode
We use vitest framework.
our test use vitest framework.
test command: `bun run test`
coverage test command: `bun run test -- --coverage`

## Testing for packages/vscode
We use mocha framework, when creating test, do not use mocks for filesystem, just use vscode.workspace.fs to create files and folders, and only use mocha primitives for testing. use sinon for mocks.

(assuming cwd is packages/vscode)
test command: `bun run test`
coverage test command: `bun run test:coverage`

When encountering issues like `TypeError: Descriptor for property readFile is non-configurable and non-writable`, please use `proxyquire` to mock the module.

# Misc
1. use `bun check` to format / linting the code, use `bun fix` to automatically apply the fix.
2. use `bun tsc` to check the types.
3. For packages/code it uses `ink` for react terminal ui.
4. Prefer `@/lib` over `../lib` for imports.
5. For global variable in typescript, prefer using PascalCase, e.g `GlobalVariableName`, instead of `GLOBAL_VARIABLE_NAME`.
6. For biome related warning / errors, prefer using `bun fix` in the root directory to fix the issues.
```

## Locations

Pochi looks for rules in two locations:

### Workspace

Pochi first checks for a `README.pochi.md` (or `AGENTS.md`) file in your current workspace root directory. This is where you define project-specific rules that apply only to your current project.

### Global

Pochi also reads global rules defined in `~/.pochi/README.pochi.md`. These rules apply to all projects and are suitable for any personal rules that Pochi should follow.

You can view current active rules in toolbar's token usage popover

--------------

# Share

The **Share** feature in Pochi's toolbar allows you to share your current development context with others.

<Callout type="info" title="Public Access">
  Shared conversations are publicly accessible to anyone with the link. Do not share sensitive information or private code.
</Callout>

<p align="center">
  ![Task Sharing](../assets/images/task-sharing.png)
</p>

### How it works

When you share a conversation, Pochi:

1. Persist your task to our servers, and create a unique public URL for the task..
2. Makes task accessible via a link - `app.getpochi.com/share/<shareId>`


# Slack

# Slack

Pochi's Slack integration allows you to use Pochi directly within your Slack workspace, bringing AI-powered development assistance to your team conversations.
Start tasks in Slack and seamlessly switch to the Cloud IDE when you need the full development experience.

<Callout type="info" title="Cloud IDE">
  When you send messages to Pochi in Slack, tasks are executed in remote environment running in the cloud. You can switch to the Cloud IDE to continue working on the task.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

### Adding Pochi to Your Workspace

1. **Install the Integration**: Add Pochi to your Slack workspace through the `Add to Slack` button on the [homepage](https://app.getpochi.com/home)
   ![Slack Installation](../assets/images/slack-install-home.png)
2. **Authorize Access**: Grant the necessary permissions for Pochi to interact with your Slack channels
   ![Slack Authorization](../assets/images/slack-authorize.png)
3. **Start Collaborating**: Begin using Pochi in any channel or direct message where it's been added. If using channels, please make sure to invite Pochi to the channel before creating a task.

### Basic Usage

Once Pochi is added to your workspace:

1. \[Optional] **Invite Pochi to Channels**: If you want to interact with Pochi in channels, simply send `@Pochi` in the channel, and you will be prompted to invite Pochi to the channel.
2. \[Optional] **Default Github Repository**: Set the repository in the Channel Topic, so Pochi knows which repository to work on by default.
   * Format: `[repo:OWNER/REPO]`, for example, `[repo:TabbyML/pochi]`
3. **Start Task**: Send a task prompt to Pochi in Direct Messages or channels using the following format:
   * If a default repository is set: `/newtask PROMPT`, for example, `/newtask What are recent commits`
   * If no default repository is set or you want to run Pochi with another repository : `/newtask [OWNER/REPO] PROMPT`, for example, `/newtask [TabbyML/tabby] What are recent commits`
4. **Real-time Updates**: Watch as Pochi executes tasks and provides updates directly in Slack.
5. **Follow-up**: After the task is completed, Pochi might ask some follow-up questions, or you can provide responses clicking the option buttons or the Reply button.

![Slack Task](../assets/images/slack-task.png)

### Continue in Cloud IDE

When you need the full IDE experience:

1. **Access Task Page**: Click on the `See Details` button to navigate to the task in Pochi's web interface.
2. **Click Remote Icon**: Look for the remote/external link icon in the task interface.
   ![Slack Remote Button](../assets/images/slack-remote-button.png)
3. **Continue Development**: Pick up exactly where you left off.
   ![Slack VSCode Web](../assets/images/slack-vscode-web.png)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**`not_in_channel` error when creating task in channel**

* Verify that Pochi has been properly added to the channel.
* Mention @Pochi in the channel if Pochi is not invited to the channel.

**Cannot access Cloud IDE**

* Only the Task Owner has permission to access the Cloud IDE.
* Make sure you are the Task Owner and logged in to Pochi with the same account in your browser.

----------------

# Workflows

Workflows are step-by-step automation templates that guide Pochi through complex, multi-step processes. Think of them as detailed recipes that Pochi can follow to complete common development tasks consistently and efficiently.

### Configure

Workflows shall be put inside `.pochi/workflows/` directory in your workspace root. Each workflow is a markdown file with a specific name.

`.pochi/workflows/create-pr.md` is an example we used in Pochi's own development.

```markdown
Please help create a PR for the current staging changes, following these guidelines:
- If there are no staging changes but there are uncommitted changes, please stage them first.
- Create a branch name based on the current git diff status.
- Write a meaningful commit message/PR title.
- Use the gh CLI to create a PR.
- When running the push operation, it might be aborted due to a husky pre-push hook. For formatting issues, amend the files and try again. For other issues, try to resolve them as much as possible.
- The base branch for the PR should always be `main`.
- Always push the branch to the remote repository before creating the PR.

When creating PR with markdown description, pay attention to escape backticks, otherwise it will be executed as command substitution in the shell.
```

### Usage

Once your workflows are set up, using them is straightforward:

1. **Type `/` in VS Code** to trigger the Pochi workflow selector
2. **Select a workflow** from the dropdown menu and press `Enter`.
3. You can attached additional context when running the workflow, e.g `/create-pr assign Meng for review after creation`.
