# Auto Compact

Auto Compact helps you keep long conversations efficient by summarizing earlier messages when your token usage grows large. You can either:

* Compact in the current task (inject a compact summary so you can continue seamlessly)
* Start a new task with the summary (spawn a fresh task seeded with a concise recap)

![Auto Compact overview](../assets/images/auto-compact.png)

## When Auto Compact is available

Auto Compact becomes available from the token usage chip in the toolbar when all of the following are true:

* The conversation isn’t streaming or executing
* The chat isn’t read-only
* No other compact action is pending
* Total tokens ≥ 50,000 (min threshold)

If the threshold isn’t met, you’ll see a tooltip explaining that more tokens are required to compact.

While compacting, the chip shows a spinner with the “Compacting” label.

![Compacting in progress](../assets/images/auto-compacting.png)

## Two ways to compact

### Option A — Compact in current task

Use this to stay in the same task. Pochi will:

1. Generate a concise summary of the conversation up to your latest message
2. Inject a compact block at the top of your last user message
3. Continue the conversation with the condensed context

> Notes: The summary is wrapped into a compact section and prepended to your last message to preserve intent while saving context.

### Option B — Start new task with summary

Use this to branch a fresh task based on the current work. Pochi will:

1. Create a summary of the existing conversation
2. Open a new task seeded with the summary and a short handoff message
3. Navigate you to the new task to continue

![Inline compact summary in current task (expandable)](../assets/images/auto-compact-with-new-task-summery.png)

## Technical Details

* Trigger: You choose either “Compact task” (inline) or “New task with summary”.
* Summary prompt: Pochi asks the model to produce a concise recap focused on key topics, decisions, and important context (limited to a few thousand tokens of output).
* Inline compact: The recap is wrapped in a compact block and prepended to your last user message before the next response.
* New task: The recap becomes the first message of a brand-new task, followed by a short instruction letting the agent analyze status and confirm next steps.
* Safety/availability: Buttons are disabled during streaming/execution, or when below the minimum token threshold.

## Tips

* Prefer inline compact when you want continuity within the same task.
* Use “new task with summary” to cleanly branch, hand over, or checkpoint work.
* You’ll see a “Compacting” state while the summary is being generated—this can take a moment for very long threads.


# Checkpoints

***

title: Checkpoints
icon: "Route"

# Checkpoints

Checkpoints automatically save a snapshot of your workspace after key steps in a task. They help you track changes, roll back when needed, and explore different implementations without worrying about breaking your code.

<div align="center">
  ![Checkpoint overview](../assets/images/checkpoint-overview.png)
</div>

## How checkpoints work

Pochi creates a checkpoint after important actions such as file edits or applied fixes. These checkpoints:

* Run alongside your Git workflow without interference
* Preserve the conversation context when restoring (chat and task context remain intact)
* Track file changes using a shadow Git repository (no writes to your real repository)

Example: while developing a feature, the assistant updates multiple files. Each change creates a checkpoint. You can review each modification, and if needed, roll back to any point without impacting your main branch or real Git history.

## Viewing changes and restoring

After each key action, you can:

1. Click Compare to see modified files and diffs
2. Click Restore to open restore options

<div align="center">
  ![Checkpoint compare](../assets/images/checkpoint-compare.png)
</div>

## Restore options

To go back to a previous point:

1. Click Restore next to any step
2. Choose how you want to restore:
   * Restore Workspace and Task (when available): revert both code and task context
   * Restore Task Only (when available): keep code changes, revert task context
   * Restore Workspace Only: revert code while preserving task context (current default)

Note: The current version focuses on “Restore Workspace Only.” Other options will appear as their capabilities are enabled.

<div align="center">
  ![Checkpoint restore options](../assets/images/checkpoints-restore.png)
</div>

## Under the hood

In VS Code, Pochi implements checkpoints with a shadow Git that stays separate from your real repository:

* Initializes a bare repository under the extension’s storage directory (scoped per workspace)
* Points the worktree to your workspace, then stages and commits changes into the shadow repo
* Excludes common large/binary/cache/build artifacts (see Exclusions) to keep things fast and stable

This shadow repo is fully independent. Saving or restoring checkpoints does not create commits in your actual Git repository.

## Requirements

* **Git** must be installed (the shadow Git depends on it). If Git isn’t available, the checkpoint feature can’t initialize and will be disabled.

## Smart detection and exclusions

Pochi automatically detects and excludes heavy or redundant files to keep checkpoints lean and fast, including:

* Build artifacts and dependency folders
* Media files and large binaries
* Cache, logs, and temporary files
* Environment configuration files
* Files tracked by Git LFS

With this smart filtering, checkpoints focus on core code changes—making diffs clearer and restores faster.

----------------------

# CLI

Pochi offers a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to run an AI agent directly from the command line.

## Oneliner Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://getpochi.com/install.sh | bash
```

Alternatively, you can install pochi using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install tabbyml/pochi/pochi
```

## Authentication

The Pochi CLI uses the same authentication credentials as the VS Code extension for Pochi's cloud services. When you sign in through the VS Code extension, the CLI automatically reuses these credentials.

Credentials are stored in `~/.pochi/config.jsonc`. To authenticate:

1. Install and open the [Pochi VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabbyML.pochi)
2. Follow the sign-in prompts in the extension
3. The CLI will automatically use the same credentials

For non-Pochi models, first configure it in your Pochi configuration file (`~/.pochi/config.jsonc`). See [Models documentation](./models.mdx) for details on how to configure custom providers.

Then you can use the model by specifying the provider and model ID separated by a slash:

```bash
pochi --model groq/llama3-8b-8192 -p "What is the time now?"
```

## Usage

You can pass a prompt to run a task:

```bash
pochi -p "What is the time now?"
```

Or pipe input as a prompt:

```bash
echo "What is the time now?" | pochi
```

For detailed usage instructions, run `pochi -h`, below is the output fom version 0.5.3

```
Usage: pochi [options]

Pochi v0.5.5

Prompt:
  -p, --prompt <prompt>   Create a new task with the given prompt. You can also
                          pipe input to use as a prompt, for example: `cat
                          .pochi/workflows/create-pr.md | pochi`. To use a
                          workflow, use /workflow-name, for example: `pochi -p
                          /create-pr`. Workflows can be embedded in larger
                          prompts, for example: `pochi -p "please /create-pr
                          with feat semantic convention"`

Options:
  --max-steps <number>    Maximum number of stepsto run the task. If the task
                          cannot be completed in this number of rounds, the
                          runner will stop. (default: 24)
  --max-retries <number>  Maximum number of retries to run the task in a single
                          step. (default: 3)

Model:
  --model <model>         The model to use for the task. (default:
                          "qwen/qwen3-coder")

Others:
  -V, --version           Print the version string.
  -h, --help              Print this help message.
```

## Debugging

To enable debug logging for the CLI, you can set the `POCHI_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
POCHI_LOG=debug pochi -p "What is the time now?"
```

This will output detailed logs about the CLI's operation, which can be helpful for troubleshooting issues.

For more granular control, you can specify log levels for specific components:

```bash
POCHI_LOG=Pochi=debug,TaskRunner=trace pochi -p "What is the time now?"
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

# Custom Agents

Pochi allows you to define custom agents to handle specific tasks. These agents can be tailored with their own system prompts and sets of tools, enabling you to create specialized assistants for your workflows.

## Defining a Custom Agent

Custom agents are defined in `.md` files located in either the project's `.pochi/agents/` directory or the system-wide `~/.pochi/agents/` directory.

An agent definition file consists of two parts: a frontmatter section for configuration and a content section for the system prompt.

Here is an example of a custom agent definition:

```markdown
---
name: your-custom-agent-name
description: Description of when this custom agent should be invoked
tools: tool-1, tool-2, tool-3 # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
---

Your custom agent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs
and should clearly define the custom agent's role, capabilities, and approach
to solving problems.

Include specific instructions, best practices, and any constraints
the custom agent should follow.
```

### Configuration

The frontmatter provides metadata for the custom agent:

* `name` (required): A unique name for your agent.
* `description` (required): A short description of what the agent does. This is used to help Pochi decide when to use your agent.
* `tools` (optional): A list of tools that the agent is allowed to use. If omitted, the agent inherits all available tools.

### System Prompt

The content of the file after the frontmatter is the system prompt for the agent. This prompt should define the agent's role, capabilities, and how it should behave.

## Using a Custom Agent

You can mention the custom agent's name in your prompt, and Pochi may decide to use it based on the context.

## Managing Custom Agents

You can manage your custom agents through the Pochi interface or by directly manipulating the agent definition files. The common operations include:

* **List**: View all available agents in the `.pochi/agents/` directory or in Pochi settings.
* **Create**: Create a new `.md` file in the `.pochi/agents/` directory.
* **Delete**: Remove the corresponding agent file.
* **Edit**: Modify the agent's definition file.

# GitHub

Use Pochi’s AI assistant directly in your GitHub repository by commenting on pull requests to perform code reviews, explain changes, and suggest improvements.

<Callout type="info" title="How it works">
  This integration runs inside a GitHub Actions runner. It temporarily installs
  the pochi CLI and executes tasks in the context of your repository. Progress
  is continuously updated under the triggering comment, and a final result
  (✅/❌) is posted when finished.
</Callout>

## Setup

Create a workflow file `.github/workflows/pochi.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: pochi

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  pochi:
    if: startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/pochi')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Run pochi
        uses: tabbyml/pochi/packages/github-action@main
        env:
          # Required: Pochi session token (get it from app.getpochi.com and add as a repository secret)
          POCHI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.POCHI_TOKEN }}
          # Optional: custom model (defaults to CLI's default model if not set)
          # See the Models page for model options and configuration
          # POCHI_MODEL: google/gemini-2.5-pro
```

Notes:

* Triggered by `issue_comment` (created) and runs only if the comment body starts with `/pochi`
* Requires write permissions to read changes, post comments, and add reactions to PRs
* Provide `POCHI_TOKEN` via env; optionally set `POCHI_MODEL` to customize the model
* By default, the action uses GitHub's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (github-actions bot). You can customize this by setting a custom `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with your own Personal Access Token (PAT)

## Usage

Comment on a PR with `/pochi` followed by your request, e.g. `/pochi review this code`, `/pochi explain the changes in this PR`, `/pochi suggest improvements`.

![Comment example](../assets/images/github-comment.png)

Once triggered:

* Pochi reacts to your comment with 👀 to indicate it’s running
* A progress comment is updated every 15 seconds
* When finished, it posts the final result and reacts with 🚀 (success) or −1 (failure)

![Progress example](../assets/images/github-progress.png)

![Actions run example](../assets/images/github-action-run.png)

Permission requirement: Only users with write/admin permission can trigger execution. Otherwise, an error will be posted as a comment.

## Advanced configuration

### Use a custom GitHub token (optional)

By default, the action uses the GitHub-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`. For cross-repo or higher-privileged operations, you can override it with a PAT:

```yaml
- name: Run pochi
  uses: tabbyml/pochi/packages/github-action@main
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Your PAT
    POCHI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.POCHI_TOKEN }}
```

### Permissions

Ensure the workflow includes these permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write # Read repo contents and commit changes if needed
  issues: write # Comment on issues/PRs
  pull-requests: write # Access PR information and status
```

## Installation

Install the Pochi extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabbyML.pochi) or [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/TabbyML/pochi).

We recommend dragging Pochi to the right side of your VSCode window to get the best experience.

![Drag to right sidebar](../assets/images/vscode-right-sidebar.png)

With Pochi, you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys. Use the VS Code command `Pochi: Open Custom Model Settings` to open the settings file and [configure it](./models). Alternatively, Pochi offers cloud-based services. Creating a Pochi account gives you access to:

* Pochi's managed LLM models
* Shared task histories and team management
* Integrations with GitHub and Slack for a collaborative workflow

To use these features, sign up at [app.getpochi.com](http://app.getpochi.com) and log in to your VS Code extension.

## Customize

You can tailor Pochi to your needs by editing its configuration file, located at `~/.pochi/config.jsonc`. The file uses the JSONC (JSON with Comments) format, so you can add notes to explain your settings.

```jsonc
{
  // The schema enables autocompletion and validation in your code editor.
  "$schema": "https://getpochi.com/config.schema.json",

  // For details on available options, see the "Models," "Rules," pages in the sidebar
  // ...
}

# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** revolutionizes how Pochi interacts with external services, databases, and APIs. Think of MCP as a universal adapter that connects Pochi to virtually any data source or tool, dramatically expanding what your AI assistant can accomplish.

## Configure

Use the VSCode command `Pochi: Open MCP Server Settings` to open the settings.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

After saving the configuration, you will see the MCP server appear in the **Tools** section of Pochi's settings page.

![MCP Server Context7](../assets/images/mcp-context7.png)

You can use the toggle switch to enable or disable the MCP server entirely. You can also click on the tool badge to toggle individual tools within the MCP server.

# Permissions

By default, all permissions in Pochi are enabled. You can customize these permissions at any time using the Auto-Approve settings.

<p align="center">
  ![Auto Approve](../assets/images/auto-approve.png)
</p>

* **Read**: Read the file content Pochi decides to look up for analyzing or completing tasks.
* **Write**: Creates new files, edits existing code, generates boilerplate, and writes documentation.
* **Execute**: Manages dependencies, runs builds, tests, and perform system operations.
* **Use MCP**: Interacts with databases, APIs, and other external services to expand its capabilities with MCP server.
* **Retry**: Automatically retries failed commands, code changes, and installations.


# Rules

title: Rules
description: Define coding standards and development guidelines

# Rules

You can provide custom instructions to Pochi by creating an `README.pochi.md` file. This is similar to CLAUDE.md or Cursor’s rules.

<Callout title="AGENTS.md support">
  Pochi also supports [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) as an alternative to `README.pochi.md`. Both files serve the same purpose and are treated identically by Pochi.
</Callout>

### Example

Below example is the `README.pochi.md` file for Pochi itself.

```markdown
Pochi is an project developed using following technologies:
1. always use kebab-case for filenames.
2. always use camelCase for variables, functions.
3. use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types.

# Testing for non packages/vscode
We use vitest framework.
our test use vitest framework.
test command: `bun run test`
coverage test command: `bun run test -- --coverage`

## Testing for packages/vscode
We use mocha framework, when creating test, do not use mocks for filesystem, just use vscode.workspace.fs to create files and folders, and only use mocha primitives for testing. use sinon for mocks.

(assuming cwd is packages/vscode)
test command: `bun run test`
coverage test command: `bun run test:coverage`

When encountering issues like `TypeError: Descriptor for property readFile is non-configurable and non-writable`, please use `proxyquire` to mock the module.

# Misc
1. use `bun check` to format / linting the code, use `bun fix` to automatically apply the fix.
2. use `bun tsc` to check the types.
3. For packages/code it uses `ink` for react terminal ui.
4. Prefer `@/lib` over `../lib` for imports.
5. For global variable in typescript, prefer using PascalCase, e.g `GlobalVariableName`, instead of `GLOBAL_VARIABLE_NAME`.
6. For biome related warning / errors, prefer using `bun fix` in the root directory to fix the issues.
```

## Locations

Pochi looks for rules in two locations:

### Workspace

Pochi first checks for a `README.pochi.md` (or `AGENTS.md`) file in your current workspace root directory. This is where you define project-specific rules that apply only to your current project.

### Global

Pochi also reads global rules defined in `~/.pochi/README.pochi.md`. These rules apply to all projects and are suitable for any personal rules that Pochi should follow.

You can view current active rules in toolbar's token usage popover

# Share

The **Share** feature in Pochi's toolbar allows you to share your current development context with others.

<Callout type="info" title="Public Access">
  Shared conversations are publicly accessible to anyone with the link. Do not share sensitive information or private code.
</Callout>

<p align="center">
  ![Task Sharing](../assets/images/task-sharing.png)
</p>

### How it works

When you share a conversation, Pochi:

1. Persist your task to our servers, and create a unique public URL for the task..
2. Makes task accessible via a link - `app.getpochi.com/share/<shareId>`


# Slack

# Slack

Pochi's Slack integration allows you to use Pochi directly within your Slack workspace, bringing AI-powered development assistance to your team conversations.
Start tasks in Slack and seamlessly switch to the Cloud IDE when you need the full development experience.

<Callout type="info" title="Cloud IDE">
  When you send messages to Pochi in Slack, tasks are executed in remote environment running in the cloud. You can switch to the Cloud IDE to continue working on the task.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

### Adding Pochi to Your Workspace

1. **Install the Integration**: Add Pochi to your Slack workspace through the `Add to Slack` button on the [homepage](https://app.getpochi.com/home)
   ![Slack Installation](../assets/images/slack-install-home.png)
2. **Authorize Access**: Grant the necessary permissions for Pochi to interact with your Slack channels
   ![Slack Authorization](../assets/images/slack-authorize.png)
3. **Start Collaborating**: Begin using Pochi in any channel or direct message where it's been added. If using channels, please make sure to invite Pochi to the channel before creating a task.

### Basic Usage

Once Pochi is added to your workspace:

1. \[Optional] **Invite Pochi to Channels**: If you want to interact with Pochi in channels, simply send `@Pochi` in the channel, and you will be prompted to invite Pochi to the channel.
2. \[Optional] **Default Github Repository**: Set the repository in the Channel Topic, so Pochi knows which repository to work on by default.
   * Format: `[repo:OWNER/REPO]`, for example, `[repo:TabbyML/pochi]`
3. **Start Task**: Send a task prompt to Pochi in Direct Messages or channels using the following format:
   * If a default repository is set: `/newtask PROMPT`, for example, `/newtask What are recent commits`
   * If no default repository is set or you want to run Pochi with another repository : `/newtask [OWNER/REPO] PROMPT`, for example, `/newtask [TabbyML/tabby] What are recent commits`
4. **Real-time Updates**: Watch as Pochi executes tasks and provides updates directly in Slack.
5. **Follow-up**: After the task is completed, Pochi might ask some follow-up questions, or you can provide responses clicking the option buttons or the Reply button.

![Slack Task](../assets/images/slack-task.png)

### Continue in Cloud IDE

When you need the full IDE experience:

1. **Access Task Page**: Click on the `See Details` button to navigate to the task in Pochi's web interface.
2. **Click Remote Icon**: Look for the remote/external link icon in the task interface.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I get a `not_in_channel` error when creating a task in a channel?

Verify that Pochi has been properly added to the channel. If Pochi is not invited to the channel, mention @Pochi in the channel to invite it.

### Why can't I access the Cloud IDE?

Only the Task Owner has permission to access the Cloud IDE. Make sure you are the Task Owner and logged in to Pochi with the same account in your browser.

# Workflows

title: Workflows
description: Automate common development sequences
icon: "Workflow"
----------------

# Workflows

Workflows are step-by-step automation templates that guide Pochi through complex, multi-step processes. Think of them as detailed recipes that Pochi can follow to complete common development tasks consistently and efficiently.

### Configure

Workflows shall be put inside `.pochi/workflows/` directory in your workspace root. Each workflow is a markdown file with a specific name.

`.pochi/workflows/create-pr.md` is an example we used in Pochi's own development.

```markdown
Please help create a PR for the current staging changes, following these guidelines:
- If there are no staging changes but there are uncommitted changes, please stage them first.
- Create a branch name based on the current git diff status.
- Write a meaningful commit message/PR title.
- Use the gh CLI to create a PR.
- When running the push operation, it might be aborted due to a husky pre-push hook. For formatting issues, amend the files and try again. For other issues, try to resolve them as much as possible.
- The base branch for the PR should always be `main`.
- Always push the branch to the remote repository before creating the PR.

When creating PR with markdown description, pay attention to escape backticks, otherwise it will be executed as command substitution in the shell.
```

### Usage

Once your workflows are set up, using them is straightforward:

1. **Type `/` in VS Code** to trigger the Pochi workflow selector
2. **Select a workflow** from the dropdown menu and press `Enter`.
3. You can attached additional context when running the workflow, e.g `/create-pr assign Meng for review after creation`.
